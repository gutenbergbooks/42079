<h2>Preface</h2>


<hr class="chap" /><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="smcap">Long</span> before Columbus discovered America,
there were brave men in the north of Europe
who dared to sail farther out upon the unknown
waters of the Atlantic than any other
people in the world. These daring seamen
were called Vikings. Their home was the
peninsula of Scandinavia, now ruled over by
one king, although divided into two distinct
countries, Norway and Sweden.</p>

<p>It was along the shores of Norway, with
rugged mountains fringing its deep bays, that
the Vikings learned command of their curious,
high-prowed ships, and overcame all fear of
wind and storm. Their strong nature shows
itself to-day in the people of Norway, who
patiently endure many hardships while trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to get a living on the rough mountain-sides or
along the rocky coasts.</p>

<p>Many of our Norwegian cousins have come
to America to make a new home for themselves
where the sun shines more warmly and
the winds blow less keenly. Their fair-haired
children are growing up amongst us, showing
us the qualities their parents most admire.
Be brave, be honest, be kind to all creatures,
be faithful to every little duty,&mdash;these are the
lessons they have been taught from babyhood,
as well as their brothers and sisters who have
not as yet ventured far from the land they
love so well,&mdash;the land of rapid-flowing rivers,
deep, dark bays, and narrow valleys.</p>

<p>Come with me to-day to the home of one
of these blue-eyed cousins and join her for
a while in her work and play.</p>

<h2>MARI<br />

Our Little Norwegian Cousin</h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FARM</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Come</span>, Mari, my little daughter, and you
shall help me make the cakes," called her
mother.</p>

<p>Mari stood in the middle of the big farm-yard
with a flock of hens around her. She
was scattering grain among them from a big
bag on her arm; not a sound could be heard
except once in a while the scratching of the
hens' feet. They were too busy to notice each
other or the big dog that sat on the door-step.</p>

<p>The little girl laughed quietly as she watched
them. "They are so happy; they love this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
pleasant summer-time as much as I do," she
said to herself.</p>

<p>But the moment she heard her mother's
voice, she turned quickly toward the house
without stopping a moment longer to see
whether her pet hen, Biddy Wee, or cross old
Yellow Legs got the most dinner. Mari never
in her life thought of answering her parents by
saying:</p>

<p>"Why, papa?" or "Why, mamma?" or
"I'll come in a moment."</p>

<p>Mari lives in Norway, and Norwegian parents
train their children to obey without delay.</p>

<p>The little girl was only too glad to come
now, however. Her mother had promised she
should learn to make flat-bread to-day. She
was pleased that she was old enough to be
trusted with this important work. Why, she
could keep house alone when she had mastered
this necessary art, and her mother could leave
her in charge.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Mari remembers when she was such a tiny tot
that her head barely reached above the table.
Even then she loved to watch her mother
as she sat at the big moulding-board, rolling
out the dough until it was nearly as thin as
paper.</p>

<p>This dough was made of barley-meal which
was raised here at the farm. It was rolled out
into sheets almost as wide as the table itself,
for each cake must be about a half-yard across.
Then came the cooking. The cake was lifted
from the board to a hot flat stone on the fireplace,
where it was quickly baked. How fast
the pile grew! and how skilful mother always
was. She never seemed to burn or break a
single cake.</p>

<p>Wherever you go in Mari's country you
will find flat-bread. You can eat quantities of
it, if you like, yet somehow it will not easily
check your hunger, and it gives little strength.</p>

<p>"Now, dear, be careful not to get a grain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dust on the floor," said her mother, as Mari
stood at the table ready for directions.</p>

<p>The child looked very pretty, with her long,
light hair hanging down her back in two braids.
The snowy kerchief was tied under her chin
just as it was when she came in from the farm-yard.
She had no need to put on an apron
before beginning her work, for she already
wore one. She was never without it, in fact,
and hardly thought herself dressed in the
morning until her apron had been fastened
around her plump little waist.</p>

<p>Her cheeks looked rosy enough to kiss, but
such a thing seldom happened, for mothers in
Norway believe that is a bad habit. They
think that it often leads to the carrying of
disease from one person to another.</p>

<p>"Shake hands with the baby and the children,"
they would say, "but please don't kiss
them." They are wise in this,&mdash;don't you
think so?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Mari had rolled out six cakes, her
cheeks grew rosier yet. It was hard work,
although it had seemed easy enough when
mother was doing it.</p>

<p>The first three cakes had to be rolled over
and over again because they would stick to the
board. Then the lifting was not such a simple
thing as Mari had supposed before she came to
do it herself. But she kept trying. Her
mother was very patient and encouraged her
with loving smiles and kind words. At last
the little girl made a really <i>good</i> cake and
landed it all by herself on the stone, without
doubling, or even wrinkling, it.</p>

<p>"Good, good," said her mother, "you will
soon be a real helper, Mari. But now you
have worked long enough for the first time.
I will finish the baking while you take the
baby and give him an airing."</p>

<p>And where was the baby, bless him? Mari
knew, for she went at once to the other side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the room where a pole was fastened into the
wall. A big basket was hanging down from
the end of this pole, and in the basket was a
little blue-eyed baby, cooing softly to himself.</p>

<p>Mari's mother was a very busy woman.
There was always something to do, either
inside the house or out-of-doors. She had
very little time for holding a baby. So when
Mari and her brothers were away at school,
and mother was left alone, that dear little rosy-cheeked
fellow sometimes began to cry in a
very lively manner. The cooking and the
cheese-making and the spinning must go on
just the same, and time could not be spent
in holding a baby.</p>

<p>But he must be amused in some way. So
the strong pole was fastened into the wall,
and the cradle attached to the end. Do you
wonder what fun there could be in staying up
in that basket, hour after hour? The baby
enjoyed it because the pole would spring a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
little at every movement of his body. As
long as he kept awake, he could, and did,
bob up and down. That was amusement
enough.</p>

<p>He was glad to see Mari now. She was a
perfect little mother, and soon had his hood
and cloak fastened on. They were hardly
needed, for he was already done up in so
many garments, it didn't seem possible he
could be cold, wherever he went.</p>

<p>The living-room, where Mari had been
working, was large and high. The beams
were dark with age, but the floor was white
from the many scrubbings Mari's mother had
given it.</p>

<p>On one side of the room was the big fireplace
where all the cooking was done. During
the long winter evenings the family and servants
sat in front of the blazing logs and told
stories of the famous sea-captains of the olden
times. Or perhaps they talked of the fairies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and giants, in whom Mari firmly believed.
Her mother laughed at the idea of these wonderful
creatures. Yet, after all, it was not
more than a hundred years ago that they
seemed real to many grown-up people.</p>

<p>Wonderful creatures who made themselves
seen from time to time dwelt in the mountains,
the fields, and the rivers. This is what Mari's
great-grandma had believed, and was she not
a sensible woman? It is no wonder, therefore,
that our little cousin loved to think that
these beings were still real. When she went
to sleep at night, she often dreamed of the
gnomes who live far down in the earth, or the
giants who once dwelt among the mountains.</p>

<p>When she was very little she sometimes
waked up from such dreams with a shiver.
"O, don't let the cruel giant get me," she
would cry. Then she would jump out of her
own little cot into the big bed of her parents.
She felt quite safe as soon as her mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
loving arms held her tightly, and she was
sound asleep again in a minute.</p>

<p>That big bed certainly looked strong enough
to be a fortress against the giants or any other
of the wonderful creatures of fairy-world. It
stood in the corner of the living-room, where
Mari's mother worked all day, and where the
family ate and sat. It was so high that even
grown people did not get into it without climbing
up the steps at one side. It had a wooden
top, which made it seem like a little house.
It was not as long as bedsteads in other countries.
No grown person could stretch out in
it to his full length. He must bend his knees,
or curl himself up in some way, for he certainly
could not push his feet through the
heavy wooden foot-board.</p>

<p>Mari's people, however, never thought of
its being uncomfortable. All Norwegian bedsteads
are made in this way, so they became
used to it as they grew up. But sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
English travellers had stayed at the farmhouse
all night when they had been overtaken by a
storm. They would be sure to get up in the
morning complaining. They would say:</p>

<p>"O yes, this country of Norway is very
beautiful, but why don't you have beds long
enough for people to sleep in with comfort."</p>

<p>The farm where Mari lives lies in a narrow
valley half a mile from the sea. The cold
winter winds are kept off by the mountain
which stands behind the houses. No one but
Mari's family and the servants who work on
the farm live here. Yet I spoke of houses.
This is because the little girl's home is made
up of several different houses, instead of one
large farmhouse, such as one sees in America.</p>

<p>Mari's father thinks that two, or perhaps
three, rooms are quite enough to build under
one roof. He settled here when he was a
young man. Mari's mother came here to
live when they were married. At that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
there was but one house. It contained the
living-room and the storeroom. After a while
another house was built close by, for the farm
hands to sleep in. Still another little building
was added after a while for the winter's supplies,
for there is no store within many miles
of the farm.</p>

<p>Mari's mother never says, "Come, my
child, run down the road and buy me five
pounds of sugar," or, "Hurry, dear, go and
get two pounds of steak for dinner." It
would be useless for her to think of doing
such a thing. All the provisions the family
may need must be obtained in large quantities
from the distant city, unless they are raised
here on the farm.</p>

<p>The storehouse was built very carefully.
It was raised higher than the other buildings
so that rats and other wild creatures should
have hard work to reach the supplies. There
is not a great deal on hand now, for it is summer-time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
but in the autumn the bins will be
full of vegetables, and large quantities of fish
and meats will hang from the rafters. There
will be stores of butter and cheese and a large
supply of coffee, for Mari's people drink it
freely.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>VISITORS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mother</span>, mother, I hear the sound of
wheels," cried the little girl, as she came hurrying
into the house, panting for breath. The
baby was such a big load it is a wonder she
could hurry at all.</p>

<p>"Could you see what is coming?" asked
her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, there are two carriages, I know, for
I saw a cariole, and I could hear another gig,
although it was still out of sight round the
bend of the road. They must be in a hurry,
for I could hear the driver of the cariole clucking
to his horse to make him go faster."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i031.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="Woman driving a buggy with one horse" />
<span class="caption">&quot;IT WAS A SORT OF GIG WITH VERY LONG SHAFTS.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Run right down to the rye-field, Mari,
and tell your father to send Snorri up with
the horses. Leave the baby with me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Mari hurried away, while her mother went
out into the yard to greet her visitors who had
now drawn near.</p>

<p>The first carriage was a cariole, as Mari had
said. It was a sort of gig with very long
shafts. It had a seat in front just wide
enough to hold one person, with a small
place behind, where the post-boy sat. A lady
rode in this cariole and drove the sturdy little
horse.</p>

<p>Behind her came a second carriage, which
could not be very comfortable, as there were
no springs and the seat was directly over the
axle. Two people were in this, also, a gentleman
and the driver.</p>

<p>"We are in great haste to reach the next
station by afternoon," the gentleman tried to
explain to the farmer's wife. He spoke brokenly,
for he seemed to know but few Norwegian
words.</p>

<p>"He must be an American," Mari's mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
said to herself. "Those people always seem
to be in a hurry." She dropped a deep curtsy
to the lady, who seemed to be the gentleman's
wife.</p>

<p>"Won't you come into the house while you
wait for the carriage?" she asked. The
lady smiled, and followed her into the living-room.</p>

<p>"What a lovely big fireplace you have!"
exclaimed the visitor, as she sat down. "And
what good times you probably have here in
the long winter evenings. Indeed they must
seem long when the daylight only lasts two or
three hours."</p>

<p>Mari's mother smiled. "Yes, and the
summer days seem long now that there are
only two or three hours of darkness in the
whole twenty-four," she answered. "At least,
they must seem long to you who are a
stranger," she went on. She spoke in good
English, of which she was very proud. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
had learned it when she was a girl in school,
and was already teaching Mari to use it.</p>

<p>"Is that your spinning-wheel?" asked the
visitor, as she looked around the room. "Excuse
me for asking, but I do wish I could
watch you spinning. In America everything
we wear is made in the mills and factories, and
a spinning-wheel is not a common sight nowadays."</p>

<p>"I make all the clothing for my family,"
answered Mari's mother. "It is so strong
it lasts nearly a lifetime. Look at my dress;
I have worn it every working-day for many
years, and it is still as good as new."</p>

<p>"Dear me! what a smart woman you are.
If you don't mind, I should like to examine
the goods. I suppose that is what people call
homespun. And I suppose the wool of which
it was made came from your own sheep, did
it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and my husband raised every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
one of the flock himself," was the answer. "I
will gladly spin some of the wool for you now.
But see! the carriages are waiting, and your
husband looks impatient."</p>

<p>"Then I must not keep him waiting, for
we have a long journey before us. So good-bye.
Perhaps we may stop here again on our
way back from the north. Thank you very
much for your kindness."</p>

<p>The lady went out, and Snorri helped her
into the cariole and himself jumped up behind,
and away they went. The lady's husband followed
in another carriage in the same manner
they had driven into the yard. The ones that
had brought them here had gone away as soon
as the travellers stepped out. Their drivers
would take them back to the station where
they belonged.</p>

<p>"Mother, why is our house a posting-station?"
asked Mari, when the travellers
had gone. "I think it is a great bother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
No matter how busy father and the men
are, they must stop their work and harness
up the horses to carry strangers along the
road. They don't get money for it, either,
do they?"</p>

<p>"That is the way your father pays his
taxes," her mother answered. "You know
what good roads we have in our country, Mari.
You know, too, that many other things are
done by the government to make this country
a fine one. Of course every one must share in
the cost of these things. As we live on a farm
and have horses, your father is allowed to pay
his share in work. That is, he agrees to carry
the travellers who come this way to the next
station. After all, it isn't very much bother,"
she said, thoughtfully. "But come, dear, set
the table; it is near dinner-time, and your
father will soon be here."</p>

<p>The table did not stand in the middle of
the room. It was in the corner nearest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
fireplace. A wide bench was built round the
two sides of the room nearest it, so that most
of those who gathered around the table could
sit on these benches.</p>

<p>Mari's mother soon had a steaming junket
ready, besides a dish of smoked salmon,
plenty of boiled potatoes, a large, dark-coloured
cheese which looked like soap, and last,
but not least, a plate was piled high with
flat-bread.</p>

<p>"May father have the cakes I made?"
asked Mari.</p>

<p>"Sure enough, little daughter. He will eat
them with pleasure, I know."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the farmer and his helpers
appeared. All gathered around the table
together.</p>

<p>"What a fine junket this is to-day," said
Mari's father, as his wife helped him to another
plateful.</p>

<p>The junket was made of milk, barley, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
potatoes, and was a dish of which he was very
fond.</p>

<p>"Dear me! how good the flat-bread is, too.
And only to think that our little Mari made it
all herself," continued the farmer. "She will
soon be a woman at this rate."</p>

<p>Mari's rosy cheeks grew redder still at her
father's praise.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to see Gretel back again,"
said the little girl's mother, after a while. "I
miss her very much, though Mari is a good
little helper. But Gretel is having a good time
with Henrik, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Gretel and Henrik had gone up on the
mountain to the summer-house, where the
cows were pastured during the two warmest
months of the year. Henrik was now fourteen
years old, and his father felt that he could
be trusted to care for the cows as well as he
could do it himself; while Gretel could make
good cheese and butter, although she was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
thirteen. This boy and girl were now living
together all alone up on the mountain-side,
but they were not the least bit lonely.</p>

<p>Every Saturday afternoon Henrik brought
down the butter and cheese his sister had made
during the week. He had so many stories to
tell of their good times, that Mari would say:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Henrik, I wish I could go
back with you."</p>

<p>"I wish you could, little sister, but mother
must not be left alone, you know." And
Henrik would put his arms around her and
kiss her lovingly.</p>

<p>"Where is Ole?" asked the farmer, as the
family finished eating their dinner. "He
should not be late to meals and give you
trouble, good wife."</p>

<p>"He went up to the river on a fishing trip.
I told him I should not scold if he was late
this time," said his mother. "I was glad of
the thought of having some fresh salmon."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, then. But come, my men, we
must get back to the field now. The noon
hour has passed." And the farmer led the
way out of the house.</p>

<p>But before he rose from the table little
Mari said:</p>

<p>"Thanks for the food, dear father and
mother," while she went first to one, then
the other, and gave each of them a loving
kiss.</p>

<p>Then the workmen rose and went in turn
to the farmer and his wife and shook hands, to
show they, too, were thankful.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant and cheerful in this
farmer's house, you can plainly see; and it
was all quite natural for these simple country
people to show how kindly they felt for each
other.</p>

<p>"There comes Ole, now," said the farmer's
wife. "I can hear his call. Run, Mari, and
see if he has met with good fortune."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, mother, mother, see what I have
here," cried Mari, a few moments afterward.
"Ole has a fine string of fish, and that will
please you, I know. But do look at this
young magpie. It was snared in his trap
while he was fishing. He says I may have
it for my very own. May I keep it,
please?"</p>

<p>"It seems as though you had enough pets
now, Mari. You have your own pony and
your dog Kyle. But I hate to refuse you, my
dear. Yes, you may have it, but you and Ole
must keep it out of mischief. Magpies are
sometimes very troublesome birds, for they
notice shining objects and carry them off if
they get a chance."</p>

<p>Mari's mother now turned to the string of
trout which she hastened to put away in the
storeroom. Ole had cleaned them nicely before
he brought them home. He now ate his
dinner as quickly as possible, after which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and his sister went out into the yard to make
a cage for their new pet.</p>

<p>"In a little while he will get tame so he
will follow us around," said Ole, as he cut
the wooden bars for the cage. "Then we
shall need to shut him up only when we
wish."</p>

<p>"Isn't he a beauty," exclaimed Mari, as
she stroked the magpie. "Look, Ole, at the
green and purple feathers in his wings and tail.
They are very handsome and glossy."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Mari, or he may bite you.
That hooked bill of his is pretty sharp, if
he is a young bird. See him look at you
with his bright eyes. They say that magpies
will grow fond of one in a very short
time."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a magpie's nest, Ole?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I passed one this morning as I
went through the woods. It was way back
in a thick bush. I crept up and looked in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
The mother bird was away, and I saw five
pretty green eggs dotted with little purple
spots."</p>

<p>"What did you do, Ole? I hope you did
not touch them."</p>

<p>"At first, I thought I would, Mari, because,
you know, those pretty eggs will sometime
hatch out, and the five magpies will fly away
to harm smaller and more helpless birds. Besides,
they go into the grain-fields and pick
the grain. Father isn't very fond of magpies,
I can tell you.</p>

<p>"But after thinking for a moment I said to
myself, 'No, mother magpie sha'n't be made
unhappy to-day by coming home to find her
nest empty.' Then I went away, and ended
my morning's sport by trapping this young
fellow."</p>

<p>Ole kept on working while he talked. He
did his work so cleverly that one could see
he was quite a carpenter. He was a tall boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
for twelve years, and looked healthy and
happy.</p>

<p>You might possibly have laughed at his
clothes, for he wore a pair of his father's old
trousers, and they were gathered in at the
waist to keep them in place. They must have
been cut off at the knees so that they should
not be too long for the boy. That was the
only change made. His mother said:</p>

<p>"There, those trousers are too much worn
for my husband to use any longer. They will
do very well for Ole as he runs about on the
farm. I will not take time to cut them any
smaller. On holidays the boy shall wear his
fine clothes, of course."</p>

<p>It is no wonder the good woman had to be
careful of her time, for she not only spun,
wove, and made their clothing, but she also
spun the yarn and knit their stockings. Ole's
stockings are often patched with leather to
make them last longer. But his feet are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
not tender, and he does not mind it in the
least.</p>

<p>"What kind of a nest did the magpie
have?" asked Mari, as Ole finished the cage
and they placed the bird inside.</p>

<p>"It was lined with wool and hair and had a
sort of roof over it. The opening was very
narrow; I really don't see how the mother-bird
could get in and out."</p>

<p>"I suppose the roof is to protect the young
birds from enemies, don't you, Ole?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mari; but come, let us go and find
some worms for our bird. He must be
hungry."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CHRISTENING</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">O mother</span>, I have something to tell you.
I have just been down to the village, and I
heard there that neighbour Hans's wife has a
new baby. It is a boy. Every one says he is
a fine little fellow," said Mari, one beautiful
afternoon.</p>

<p>"Dear me! dear me! that is fine news,
truly," said her mother. "I must make her a
dish of my best porridge and take it to her in
the morning."</p>

<p>"Did everybody remember you when I was
born, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, the people of the village seemed
to vie with each other in preparing a dish of
flödegrod. It did taste so good! It was hard
to tell whose was the best. You must learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
how to make this cream porridge now, Mari;
you are quite old enough. You will never be
thought a good housekeeper if you cannot
make smooth flödegrod."</p>

<p>"The baby is to be christened next week.
Everybody will be there, of course, mother."</p>

<p>The farm was only half a mile from a little
fishing village on the shore of a deep bay.
Such a long, narrow bay is called a fiord.
There are many fiords in Norway.</p>

<p>There were only about a dozen cottages in
the village, but in their midst was a tiny little
church and a small building used as the schoolhouse.
But school was not kept there all the
year round. Half of the time the master
taught in this place, and the rest of the year he
spent in another little village a few miles up
the coast. Neither of them was large enough
to pay for a teacher the whole year round.
The children, however, were glad to work
hard while he was among them. They loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
their teacher and their school, and they learned
quickly.</p>

<p>Every one in the place was busy now, getting
ready for the christening. At last came
the great day, as bright and sunny a one as
could be wished.</p>

<p>All the work on the farm was stopped and
every one in the family was dressed in his best.
Mari had a fresh white linen kerchief tied
under her chin, and also a finely starched
apron. Her plump little arms were bare.
Her stomacher was worked with bright beads
on scarlet cloth. She had embroidered it all
herself and she could not help being proud
of it.</p>

<p>But perhaps you do not know what a
stomacher is. It is a piece of cloth worn as an
ornament on the waist and over the stomach.
Mari's mother wore one also, but hers was
sparkling with silver trimmings that had belonged
to her great-grandmother.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>How fine the father looked in his short coat
and knee-breeches. He wore a bright red
vest, over which hung his long light beard.</p>

<p>But Mari's mother was the prettiest sight of
all. Her muslin apron was trimmed with
three rows of lovely open-work. Her scarlet
waist was finished with bands of black velvet,
with the beautiful stomacher in front of that.
She had loose white linen sleeves, and such an
odd cap. You never saw one like it, I am
sure. It was made of crimped white muslin
with a wide rim over the forehead, with a
narrow band beneath that hid her hair. The
corners fell down behind nearly to the waist.</p>

<p>Her silver ornaments must also be mentioned.
They were really beautiful, and were
hundreds of years old.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="Group of people standing under a lych gate in front of a church" />
<span class="caption">THE CHRISTENING.</span>
</div>

<p>Ole looked fine, too, in a suit much like
his father's and a little round cap, fitting tightly
to his head. You would scarcely have known
the family in their holiday dress.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>They stepped off gaily, and soon reached
the village. They arrived at the church just
as the christening party reached it.</p>

<p>"Do look at the dear baby, Ole," said
Mari. "Isn't he lovely?"</p>

<p>The nurse was carrying him. He was so
swaddled in his fine clothes that you would
have almost thought he was an Indian pappoose.
Only his face could be seen. The
swaddling bands were of many colours,&mdash;red,
green, and white, and there was a large white
satin bow, of course. Every Norse baby
wears such a bow to its christening.</p>

<p>And now the flock of people followed the
minister into the little church. They passed
up to the front and gathered around the altar.</p>

<p>"The baby behaves finely, doesn't he?"
whispered Ole. "I am real proud of him
because he is to have the same name as myself.
Did you hear the minister say <i>Ole</i>,
Mari?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but look now. The baby's father
and mother and his godparents are all going
up behind the altar. What is that for?"</p>

<p>"They are laying presents there for the minister.
Of course they want to thank him for
the christening. I declare, Mari, our baby
was christened only last year, and you have
forgotten what people do at such times."</p>

<p>"I was so excited then, Ole, I don't believe
I noticed it. But come, everybody is going
out of the church. Now we shall have the
best time, for you know we are invited to the
party."</p>

<p>The building was soon empty, and all the
people started gaily for the home of the new
baby. The minister went with them, of
course. He looked very dignified in his long
black gown, with a great white ruff about his
neck. He loved his people, and took part in
all their merry-makings. Ole and Mari were
very fond of him. They ran to his side as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
soon as they got outdoors. Ole took one
hand and Mari the other.</p>

<p>It was only a few steps to the little home
of the fisherman. Everything had been made
ready for the company. The table was spread
with the good things that the Norse people
love best.</p>

<p>In the centre of the table stood the old
silver bowl from which every one must drink
to the health of the new baby. This bowl was
the most precious thing in the simple home.
It had not been used before since the parents
of the baby came here and held their wedding-feast.</p>

<p>There is much eating, and frequent handshaking.
It seemed as though the company
could only show how loving they felt toward
one another by the hearty shakes which they
gave so often.</p>

<p>When every one had eaten so much that
he could hold no more with comfort, the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was quickly cleared, and a young man brought
out a fiddle from the corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Now for some of our Norse songs," cried
one of the company.</p>

<p>"Good, good," cried all, and soon the room
was filled with lively music. The new baby
behaved very well, and went to sleep in the
midst of it.</p>

<p>But Mari's baby brother, who had come to
the party with the rest of the family, was having
too good a time to shut his eyes for a moment.
It was not until the dancing began
that his little head commenced to nod and his
eyes could keep open no longer.</p>

<p>The older folk and children sat against the
wall and talked together while the younger
people waltzed around the room.</p>

<p>"Gustav, we want to see you and Frigga in
the Spring Dance," said one of the party after
a while.</p>

<p>"O yes, Gustav, you can both do it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
well," cried another. "We must see it before
we go home."</p>

<p>Gustav stepped out into the middle of the
room and was followed by the young girl whom
he was soon to marry. Her cheeks grew rosy
as every one looked at her. She was a pretty
girl, and her long, fair braids reached way
below her waist.</p>

<p>And now the fiddler started up again with a
lively tune. Who could keep still now?
Surely Gustav could not. He took hold of
one of Frigga's hands, and away they spun
around the room. But it was not a simple
waltz such as you have seen. The young girl
held her other hand above her head and
showed her grace as she kept moving around
Gustav; she kept perfect time and step as she
did so.</p>

<p>Other odd dances followed the Spring
Dance. Ole's and Mari's eyes were wide open
with delight as they watched their older friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Whenever one of the dances came to an end,
there was a general shaking of hands in which
the children joined with a right good will.</p>

<p>The time to go home came all too soon.
But as it was near the middle of summer, it
was not dark even now at ten o'clock in the
evening.</p>

<p>"Gud nag, gud nag," cried every one, after
they had drunk again to the health of the baby
and his proud parents, and the hands of all
had been heartily shaken once more.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LOST PIN</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mari</span>, Ole, come here to me at once,"
called their mother.</p>

<p>It was the morning after the christening.
The two children were sitting with their pet
magpie under a tree near the house.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter, mother speaks
so quickly?" whispered Ole, as he and his
sister hurried to obey.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the silver brooch I wore
at my throat yesterday?" said their mother,
as soon as they came into the house.</p>

<p>The good woman seemed nervous. Her
words came quickly, which was not a common
thing, for she was a slow speaker, like other
Norse people.</p>

<p>"Why, no, mother, of course not," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Mari. "Didn't you put it away in the box
where you always keep it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my child, but I did not lock
the box as usual. I found it open just now.
Can it be possible that a thief has been here?
It does not seem probable. Besides, my other
ornaments are there safe. A thief would have
taken all."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if I could guess who
took the brooch, mother," said Ole. "It's
the magpie. You know you said magpies like
all kinds of shining objects."</p>

<p>"You handsome little mischief, have you
done it?" said the boy, as he looked at his
pet.</p>

<p>The magpie had kept his seat on Ole's
shoulder when the children came into the
house. He looked from him to the boy's
mother with bright eyes, as much as to say,
"I could tell all about it, if I wished."</p>

<p>"It seems as though the bird understands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
what we are talking about, but of course he
doesn't. Still, I believe he has done something
with your brooch, mother," said Mari.</p>

<p>"It may be so, indeed, children. The box
was possibly left open, although I am generally
so careful. If that is so, Ole and Mari,
you must find it. Unless you are able to do
so, you cannot keep your pet any longer."</p>

<p>You may be sure the children were anxious
to find the brooch now. All that day they
searched in every nook and corner of the
house and yard.</p>

<p>"You know, we let him fly around for a
long time this morning," said Ole, when night
came and still the brooch could not be found.
"If it was carried up into some tree, we may
never see it again."</p>

<p>Ole had crawled out upon the limbs of all
the trees near the house, and his legs were
pretty tired.</p>

<p>"You can't do any more to-night, children,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
said the farmer, when supper was over and the
family were gathered on the porch to talk over
the trouble. "Go to bed, and do not fret.
In the morning, let the magpie out of the
cage, and allow him to go where he pleases.
Watch him, and perhaps you will find he has
some hiding-place where he stores his treasures."</p>

<p>Those were wise words. The next morning
the children did as their father had directed,
and the magpie was set free. Five minutes
afterward he flew out of the house, and away
he went toward the barn.</p>

<p>Now it happened that a pole stretched out
from under the low roof of this building. In
winter-time a bundle of grain was fastened to
this pole from time to time. It was placed
there to give food to the hungry birds that
came that way. They might starve during
freezing weather, if kind people did not think
of them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>A bunch of the old straw was still fastened
to the pole. The magpie flew to it, and
alighted.</p>

<p>"The brooch may be stowed away in that
straw," said Ole. "I'll get a ladder and see,
anyway."</p>

<p>A moment after, the boy was shouting in
delight.</p>

<p>"I have it, I have it, Mari. How glad
mother will be. O, you naughty magpie.
We will be careful that you don't get any
more brooches of my great-grandmother's."</p>

<p>Delighted indeed was the mother when they
came in with the lost brooch.</p>

<p>"You may go down to the shore, and spend
the afternoon," she said. "You can have a
fine time with your playmates in the village."</p>

<p>A half-hour later Ole and Mari were playing
barefooted on the edge of the bay, or fiord,
as, you remember, Mari calls it. But there
was no beach of smooth sand here, for rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and ledges covered the shore. There was
only one little nook where it was easy for
boats to land.</p>

<p>The village was built at the head of this
narrow bay, as it reached far into the land. It
was a long sail out to the open ocean. Mari
had never yet seen it, although she had lived
so near the water all her life.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sight that the children
looked upon this afternoon. Great cliffs rose
high up from the water on each side of the
bay. They were so straight and tall, they
seemed to join it to the sky above.</p>

<p>A waterfall came rushing down from the top
of one of these cliffs. It made a whirlpool
in the spot where it fell into the bay. But
everywhere else the water was very quiet. It
was so still, that as you looked up to the steep
mountains on each side, it would have made
you almost fearful, it seemed so lonely and
apart from the rest of the world.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I climbed way up that cliff by the waterfall
last spring," Ole told his sister, as the
children sat down upon a rock to rest.</p>

<p>"Weren't you afraid?" she asked, as she
looked at him proudly. Then she added,
quickly, "Of course you weren't. I never
knew you to be afraid of anything in your life.
But why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"I was after down for mother's cloak. The
eider-ducks build their nests in the crannies
of the rocks. I found three of them that day,
I remember. It seemed almost too bad to
rob the nests, but still you know there is
nothing so soft and warm as the down. And
I shall be proud when mother has enough to
line her cloak and finish it."</p>

<p>"Those ducks have a queer habit of plucking
the softest feathers from their own breasts
to line their nests. Don't you think so,
Ole?"</p>

<p>"Yes, birds are a great deal nicer than we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
are apt to think. You know the mother-bird
covers the eggs with this down before she flies
away for food. She seems to understand that
they must be kept warm, and the father-duck
doesn't help her by bringing her food or
taking her place while she is away. She
has all the care on her own shoulders, poor
thing.</p>

<p>"If her nest is robbed of the down, she will
pluck more feathers from her breast and line
it again. If it happens the third time, she
flies to her mate and takes enough from him
to fill their place. But after that her patience
is worn out, she goes away and seeks another
place in which she can build a new nest undisturbed."</p>

<p>"She certainly is a wise little creature, for
she wouldn't be warm enough if she robbed
herself too much," said Mari. "Mother has
been to the city of Bergen, and she says cloaks
lined with eider-down are sold in the stores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
there, and that they are worth a great deal
of money."</p>

<p>"Of course, Mari. Some men make a
business of robbing the nests of eider-ducks.
It must be hard work, too. But see, there
comes the postman. Let's go to meet him."</p>

<p>The children looked down the bay, and
what do you think they saw?</p>

<p>At first it seemed as though a pine-tree
standing up on the water were sailing straight
toward them. But no! one could see as it
came nearer that the tree was fastened into an
odd little boat with a high curved bow. The
tree must be taking the place of a sail, for the
man inside was not rowing, yet the boat came
steadily onward.</p>

<p>"Is it rough outside?" asked Ole, as the
boat drew near.</p>

<p>"Yes, the wind was blowing so hard I did
not dare to put up the sail. But right in here
it is quiet and calm enough to suit any one."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>When the postman had carried his letters
up to the office, in the leading house in the
village, he came back to the shore and sat
down for a few moments' talk with the
children.</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful country of ours," he
said, as he looked at the shadows of the great
mountains in the water. "And we who live
here belong to a noble and a mighty race.
Never forget that, Mari, will you, my
child?"</p>

<p>"O no, Olaf, I love to think of the grand
old times when the Vikings sailed out of these
bays and travelled all over the world. They
were the ones who discovered America, weren't
they? Although I have heard it said that
the honour is given now to Columbus, the
Italian."</p>

<p>"Hundreds of years before Columbus lived,
Mari, our great seamen crossed the ocean.
Many of our people went with them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
settled in Iceland. But they did not forget
their native land and the wonderful stories
that had been handed down for centuries from
father to son.</p>

<p>"At last a wise man said, 'I will gather
together these stories of the Norse people.
I will write them down, and our children shall
have them for ever.' In this way the 'Eddas'
came to be written. They are dearer to us
now than any other books except the Bible.
Is it not so, children?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Olaf," cried Mari and Ole
together.</p>

<p>And Mari added, "We are so happy when
father reads to us from the 'Eddas.' I hardly
know what story I like best."</p>

<p>"I have sometimes heard strangers in the
land speak about our boats," Olaf went on.
"They call them old-fashioned and say they
remind them of the ships the Vikings sailed in
a thousand years ago, they have such high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
curved prows and are so broad. But what do
we care if they do call them old-fashioned?
We like it, children, for the old ways were
good ways."</p>

<p>"I wish I had lived in the time of the
Vikings," said Ole. "I should like to have
gone with them on their daring voyages. But
why were they better sailors than any other
people at that time, Olaf?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, they were strong and
brave. They loved the sea and spent their
lives upon it. They trained themselves from
boyhood to bear cold and hardships. And,
besides all these things, these deep bays
were good places for sailors to learn their
craft.</p>

<p>"But I have stayed here longer than I
thought; I must go home. This was the last
village where I had to deliver letters or I could
not have stopped with you so long. I will try
sailing back, but if I find the wind still strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
when I get outside the fiord, I can easily take
the sail down. Good-bye."</p>

<p>The postman was soon far down the bay.
He passed several fishermen in their boats just
coming back from their day's catch. Ole and
Mari waited till they came in.</p>

<p>"What luck, what luck?" cried the children.</p>

<p>"I have had such a good haul," said Gustav,
who was the first to touch the shore, "that
here is a fine large haddock to take home to
your mother, Ole."</p>

<p>"Many thanks, Gustav, my mother will be
much pleased," answered the boy, as he received
the gift. Then the two children
trudged homeward, clasping hands and singing
one of the songs they had learned at school.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BIRTHDAY</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Ten</span> years old, my daughter. Do you
believe you have grown any taller since last
night?" said Mari's mother, when she called
her that morning.</p>

<p>"It seems so, anyway," answered the little
girl, as she watched her mother making the
birthday cake.</p>

<p>"Bring the citron and currants from the
storeroom, Mari. I have sugar enough, I
think. This must be a beautiful cake for my
daughter. The frosting shall be thick. Here
comes Ole now with the flowers."</p>

<p>Ole's arms were full. "Do you think I
have enough to decorate your cake, Mari?"
He laughed as he spoke.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can't use half of them, of course.
Look at the quantity of fruit mother is using.
There! see how yellow the dough looks since
she put in the saffron. Won't it be lovely
when it is done?"</p>

<p>"Come, Ole, get to work on that tub you
are making for me. And, Mari, take your
knitting and go out on the porch. I wish to
be quiet while I watch the baking of the cake.
There will be fun enough for you this afternoon."</p>

<p>Mari's mother had promised her a coffee
party in honour of her birthday. Soon after
dinner the children began to arrive. They
were dressed in their best and looked very
happy, although the white kerchiefs tied
around the rosy faces of the girls made them
appear like little old women.</p>

<p>There was plenty of coffee to drink, for the
children of the North are as fond of it as the
older people. Then there was the magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
birthday cake, rich in the fruits and sugar, and
trimmed with the flowers Ole had gathered in
the morning. Of course, there were piles of
flat-bread on the table, besides other things
of which the children were fond.</p>

<p>Many games were played outdoors in the
sunshine. Mulberry-bush was the favourite,
and it was played over and over again.</p>

<p>"I shall never forget my tenth birthday,"
said Mari, that night, after her little friends
had gone home. "I have had a lovely time,
mother, and you were so good to let me have
the party."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/i075.jpg" width="336" height="500" alt="People in front of a cabin" />
<span class="caption">CARVED HOUSES AT THELEMARKEN.</span>
</div>

<p>"You can repay me by being more diligent
in all your work the coming year, my child.
Learn to be more careful in your knitting and
spinning. Always be ready, with a cheerful
face, to help me in the churning, and I shall
think you are growing to be a noble woman."</p>

<p>Our little cousin certainly had many duties.
Her hands were seldom idle during the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
winter afternoons and evenings, for there were
stockings to knit for Ole and herself, scarfs to
crochet, wool to be spun and woven, besides
many other things which Norse girls need to
learn if they are to grow up to be good housekeepers.</p>

<p>And Ole had much to do, also. In summer
there was plenty of work in the garden,
besides fishing and shooting the wild ducks.
During the winter time he must make many
useful things at his carpenter's bench. His
father was his teacher in this kind of work.
Why, he had made every piece of furniture in
the house; and although it was not beautiful,
it was well made and strong.</p>

<p>"I love to carve," Ole once said to his
sister. "I wish it were the fashion to decorate
our buildings as the people of Thelemarken
do. I have seen pictures of their storehouses.
They are just beautiful, Mari. The men
carve with their knives all sorts of figures on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the outside. The side posts of the porches
are fairly covered with lovely patterns."</p>

<p>"The people there don't dress as we do,
either," answered Mari. "Even the farmers
wear the same clothes at work as on the holidays.
I should think it would be hard to
keep clean their white jackets all trimmed with
silver buttons. The women there sometimes
make their aprons out of silk handkerchiefs.
And they wear their silver belts and brooches
every day. I should like to go there and see
them. Just think, Ole, I've never been
away from this place in my life!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, little sister. You and I will
travel some day and go all over our country.
We will even go to the North Cape and see
the sun set at midnight and then rise a moment
afterward. We can almost do that here
on midsummer nights, but not quite. You
know people from all over the world travel to
the North Cape, Mari."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"What else do they see there besides the
midnight sunset and sunrise?"</p>

<p>"Our friend Ernst, over in the village, went
there once. He belonged to the crew of a
ship that carries people there every summer.
He says it is a high mass of rocks, and it is
hard to climb. When you reach the top, you
can get a good view of the Arctic Ocean,
but there is nothing to see but the dreary
water; no land nor ship in sight. That is,
of course, as you look toward the north. On
one side of the cape there is a small glacier,
but those can be seen in many other parts of
the country. One doesn't need to go to the
North Cape to look at a glacier."</p>

<p>"Our teacher told me, Ole, that a long time
ago this whole country was covered with ice.
Of course, there were no people then. But
after a while the land became warmer and the
ice went away. Here and there, the ice-rivers,
or glaciers, were left among the mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and they have stayed there ever since. I
don't see why."</p>

<p>"Of course, it's terribly cold above us,
Mari, up among the mountains. The snow
falls and changes into ice. It slides slowly
down into the valleys and begins to melt, but
there is always plenty of ice above. People
like to come to our country to see the glaciers
as well as the other wonderful sights. I declare,
I'm getting sleepy and I am going to
bed. Good night, little sister."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Wedding</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">There</span> they are. They are just rounding
the point," exclaimed Mari.</p>

<p>She was standing on the shore and looking
anxiously down the bay. She was not alone,
by any means, for every one of the village was
there with her. Why were they all dressed
so finely? Why were they all looking in one
direction? And why was the church door
standing open? It was not Sunday, and it was
the time when every one was usually at work.</p>

<p>Gustav and Frigga, who lived farther up the
coast, you remember, were to be married.
There was no church in Frigga's village, so
the wedding party must come here.</p>

<p>For what would a wedding be if it were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
held in a church? Half of the beauty would
be missing.</p>

<p>Ah! here come the boats. The first one,
of course, contains the fair bride and her lover.
They sit on a raised seat, with the bridesmaid
and best man near them.</p>

<p>The bride looks quite charming with the
high silver crown on her fair head. It seems
as though a queen and her royal party were
drawing near. The boat is trimmed with
flowers, and the rowers pull with a will.</p>

<p>Two other boats follow close behind, containing
the dearest friends of the bride and
groom. As they draw near, the people on
the shore hasten to greet them with a rousing
welcome.</p>

<p>And now the procession is formed and
starts out toward the church. First comes
the fiddler with his violin under his arm.
He is followed by a man bearing a large silver
tankard. The health of the newly married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
pair will be drunk from this many times before
the festival is over. Next comes the best
man, with Gustav and Frigga close behind;
after whom follow the fathers, mothers, sisters,
and brothers of the couple. Last, come the
other relatives and friends. All are laughing
and joking, and are bright with the pretty
colours of their holiday clothes.</p>

<p>Now they enter the little church and pass
down the aisles strewn with juniper-tips. The
air is very sweet with the odour of the freshly
cut sprigs. The minister is at the altar to
meet them. He is dressed as usual in his
long black gown with the great white ruff
around his neck.</p>

<p>But the bride! How lovely she looks as
she stands with bent head, with the silver
crown resting on her fair hair. A heavy silver
chain is around her neck, and she sparkles
with rings, and brooches, and other ornaments
without number. Her stomacher is covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
with silver embroidery. Her apron is of the
finest muslin, and is also embroidered beautifully.</p>

<p>The little church was so full that Ole and
Mari were crowded near the door with the
other children. But they could see everything
that was going on.</p>

<p>"Isn't she beautiful?" whispered Mari, to
a little girl behind her. "I don't believe our
queen in her own palace can look grander than
she."</p>

<p>When the service was over, the wedding
party left the church and turned toward the
shore. Was the good time over now, do you
think? By no means, for a whole week's
merriment had only begun.</p>

<p>The bridal party seated themselves in the
boat in which they had arrived. The other
boats were quickly filled; the fiddler began to
play a lively air; the rowers pulled with long,
steady strokes, and as they moved out over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the clear, sunlit waters, one of the party began
to sing. Others joined in the song until the
air seemed filled with music.</p>

<p>Ole and Mari stood on the shore together
with the others who had not gone with the
young couple to their new home.</p>

<p>"Gustav has made a lovely new house for
Frigga," Ole told his sister. "I sailed over
there last week with Olaf, and it was just done.
The last piece of furniture was also finished.
I wish we were going there to-day; what fun
everybody will have, feasting and dancing."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Ole, we shall be grown up
before many years. And then we shall be
invited to the wedding-parties," said Mari.
"Let's go in swimming and have some fun by
ourselves this afternoon."</p>

<p>Several other children followed the example
of Ole and Mari. Soon there was such a
splashing and diving that the echoes of the
noise came sounding back from the mountainsides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Norse children are great swimmers.
When Mari was no more than five years old
she had learned to feel as much at home in
the water as the mermaids of whom her mother
told in stories. She could stay below as long
as Ole; she could dive, and tread water, and
swim backwards. There was nothing to fear,
for sharks were never seen near that shore, and
the water was so clear one could see to the
very bottom, no matter how deep it might
be.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LEGENDS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I am</span> afraid I shall have to go to lumbering
this winter," said Mari's father, as the
family sat around the great open fireplace.</p>

<p>Henrik had been home from the mountain
pasture for two weeks. It was growing cold,
and Jack Frost had paid several visits to the
farm already.</p>

<p>"What a shame it is that the crops turned
out so badly," answered his wife. "In one
more week of good weather, you could have
saved everything."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true, wife, but we cannot help
it. We lost nearly everything on account of
the frost. If you are to live in comfort, I
must earn money now in some other way.
Two of the farm-hands can go with me to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
camp in the woods, so I shall not be very
lonely."</p>

<p>The farmer looked around the cheerful
room, and sighed. Mari went to his side, and
put her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>"Dear father, we shall miss you so much,"
she said. "You will come home at Christmas,
anyway, won't you?"</p>

<p>"O yes, the camp is not so far away but I
shall try to be back for one night out of every
two weeks. Henrik and Ole will take good
care of you girls and your mother, I know.
They will be able to visit me, too. They are
both good runners on the skis (skees). Although
the camp is miles away, it will not
seem much to them, eh, Ole?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/i089.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="Boy and girl skiing with one pole down a hill" />
<span class="caption">SKI-LOBING.</span>
</div>

<p>"It will be grand sport," answered the
boy, quickly. "We will run a race to see
which one of us can get there first. Of course
Henrik will win. But who cares? I don't."</p>

<p>The two boys had been busy all day making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
new skis for themselves. Great sport the
children would have all this winter sliding
down the hillsides.</p>

<p>Coasting on sleds! yes, there was plenty of
that, too, on the snowy slopes around Mari's
home. But ski-lobing was better fun, by far.
Mari had learned to slide on skis long ago.
They were made from two strips of wood, six
feet long, with pointed ends curved upward.
When they were strapped on her stout shoes
the little girl could slide over the snow at a
wonderful rate, without sinking or falling.</p>

<p>No, there was no sport like ski-lobing.
Mari had the sled Henrik made for her two
years ago, and her two brothers sometimes
dragged her on it down to the village. Sometimes
all the children went coasting with their
sleds. "But it isn't as good as ski-lobing,"
they would always say when they came home.</p>

<p>And it was no wonder; you would agree
with them, if you could once see them travel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
It was almost like flying. They would stand
together at the top of a slope.</p>

<p>"Ready!" Henrik would cry.</p>

<p>Then away! they would all start downwards.
It seemed but a second before all were standing
at the foot of the hill, out of breath and
rosy as the reddest winter apples.</p>

<p>"Now for the top," cried the leader, after a
moment's rest; and up they would go again.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand now why Ole and
Henrik were not afraid of a long trip on skis
over the snow-covered fields and hills. They
were so skilful they would get to the camp in
two hours at most.</p>

<p>After an afternoon's sport on the hillside,
the children once more gathered in the big
living-room.</p>

<p>"Tell us some of the good old stories we
love so much," said Mari. "There is no one
who tells them so well, dear father."</p>

<p>It was the last evening he would be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
home. The next morning he must start out
for the cold, dreary camp in the woods.
Every one was feeling sad, but all tried to
hide it and seem gay and cheerful.</p>

<p>"What shall it be, a fairy-story, or a tale of
the gods and goddesses in whom the Vikings
believed?" he asked when the children had
gathered around him, in front of the blazing
logs in the fireplace.</p>

<p>"First let us hear that wonderful legend of
the beginning of the world," answered Mari.
"It is told in the Eddas, you know."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Shut your eyes and try
to think of a time when there was no earth,
nor sun, nor stars, and the Great Father was
All."</p>

<p>Mari opened her eyes after a moment and
said, softly, "How lonely it must have been,
papa."</p>

<p>"A time came, however," her father went
on, "when all was changed. For out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
thoughts of the All-Father, the Land of Winter
was formed in the far north. It was
wrapped in ice and cold and mist. Then, far
away to the south, arose the Land of Heat and
Fire, whose flames never died nor burned low.</p>

<p>"Now, between the land of darkness and
cold, and the land of light and heat, there was
a great abyss, into which the icy rivers from
the north were ever flowing. Mist rose from
these waters and rushed to meet the sparks
from the fires which were ever burning in the
south lands. And as they met, a wondrous
giant came into life, the child of Heat and
Cold."</p>

<p>"Who was there to care for him when he
was little?" asked Mari.</p>

<p>"He needed no one, because he was not
like ourselves, my dear; still, he must have
food. And so a wonderful cow appeared, to
give him milk. As she licked the ice from
the stones, a new being gradually took shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and arose. He was like ourselves, Mari, only larger,
nobler, mightier. He was the father
of all the gods, of whom you have read so
many stories. I believe you are fondest of
the god Odin, are you not, Ole?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father, and it is because so many
brave and noble things are told of him. But
please go on with the story. You haven't
yet told us how this world was made."</p>

<p>"The gods made it out of the body of the
giant, whom they were obliged to kill."</p>

<p>"They killed him because he grew wicked
and evil, didn't he, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mari, and that was a good reason,
without doubt. The gods now used all their
thought and power in making the world beautiful.
The mountains that reach up so
grandly toward the sky were their work, as
well as the beautiful valleys, the rivers winding
through the green meadows, the rushing cataracts,
and the blue lakes. It is, indeed, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wonderful earth. Round it all the gods
wrapped the great oceans which send their
arms far up into our shores."</p>

<p>"But how were the stars made?" asked
Mari.</p>

<p>"The gods first made the blue heaven
which stretches above us, and dwarfs were
put at each corner to keep it in place. Sparks
arising from the realm of fire were caught and
changed into stars, and they were set on high
to give light.</p>

<p>"A giantess whose name was Night had a
son called Day. The gods were kind to
them and gave them beautiful chariots and
swift horses with which to ride through the
heavens. Look out of the window, children,
and see how bright it is. That is because the
mane of Night's horse is shedding light upon
the earth as he travels onward.</p>

<p>"When the sun and the moon, day and
night, were established, the gods set to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to build a home for themselves. They looked
about for the most beautiful spot, and decided
upon a high plain on the summit of a lofty
mountain. The glorious city was built, and
the gods settled in their new home. It was
the Golden Age of the world, for there was
no sickness, nor death, nor sorrow, nor
pain.</p>

<p>"In the very centre of the wondrous city
the gods fashioned a golden hall for themselves,
and in it there was a shining throne
for each one. They had many games and
sports, in which they vied with each other in
strength and skill. They had a smithy, where
they shaped iron and gold and silver into
powerful tools and weapons. It was here
that the rainbow was made, which you see at
times arching over the heavens.</p>

<p>"But the gods were not satisfied. They
looked over the earth and saw no living creatures.
They said among themselves:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"'We will make the dwarfs, who shall live in
the earth and work the mines.'</p>

<p>"But this was not all, for Odin, your
favourite among the gods, said to his brothers:</p>

<p>"'Look yonder at those two trees, the ash
and the elm, standing side by side. We will
make man and woman from them. They
shall people the earth and we will care for
them as our children.'</p>

<p>"So it came to pass that our race began to
live among the hills and valleys, and has been
here ever since. But the gods have never
deserted us, but are ever ready to help and
protect us. At least, all this is what the legend
teaches."</p>

<p>"Of course, there are no real gods, are
there?" said Mari.</p>

<p>"The only gods are our beautiful souls, my
daughter. They can never die nor do evil,
any more than these gods in whom our old
Vikings really believed. The giants are our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
earthly natures that are constantly trying to
make us forget our godlike souls. But we
shall conquer them at last, just as the gods
always succeeded in mastering the giants, no
matter how strong or clever they were."</p>

<p>"Didn't it take a long time to do it, papa?
The Golden Age didn't last after quarrelling
began, did it?"</p>

<p>"No. The gods had their troubles and
sorrows as well as men. But, as I said
before, the gods always ended by being successful."</p>

<p>"Are you too tired to tell another story,
father? This time I wish we could hear something
about the fairies. Won't you tell us
about Ashiepattle?"</p>

<p>Now Ashiepattle is one of the favourites of
all Norse children, and many tales are told
of his wonderful deeds.</p>

<p>"Which story shall it be?" asked the
farmer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"The one about his eating with the troll,"
cried Mari and Ole, together.</p>

<p>Their father laughed. "You are never
tired of that, although you are almost a man,
Ole. Listen, then, and you shall hear how
this brave boy ate with the giant.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time there was a man who
had three sons. The older boys were idle and
lazy and would do no work. Their father was
too old and feeble to compel them. He had
a fine wood-lot, and he wished them to go
out and cut down the trees. Then he would
be able to sell lumber and pay his bills; but
for a long time the sons gave no heed to his
request.</p>

<p>"At length, however, they began to listen
and think the plan was a good one. The
oldest son shouldered his axe and started for
the forest. But he had no sooner begun his
work upon a big tree, than a troll suddenly
appeared at his side.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"'That is my tree,' said the troll. 'If you
cut it down, I will kill you at once.'</p>

<p>"The boy was terribly frightened. And it
is scarcely to be wondered at, for the troll was
an immense, fierce-looking creature. Dropping
his axe, he started for home on the run, and
did not stop to look around till he got there.</p>

<p>"'You coward,' cried his father when he
heard his story. 'When I was a boy no troll
was ever able to scare me away from my work.'</p>

<p>"'I will go,' said the second son. 'I shall
not be afraid, you may believe.'</p>

<p>"He started out with a brave heart, and was
soon at work in the forest. But his axe had
hardly struck the first tree when the troll
appeared before him.</p>

<p>"'Spare the tree, if you wish me to spare
your life,' cried the giant.</p>

<p>"The boy did exactly as his brother had
done before him. All his bravery disappeared
the moment he looked upon the giant. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
stopping a moment he fled for home, and
rushed into the house breathless.</p>

<p>"'What a foolish, cowardly fellow,' cried his
father. 'You are not much like me when I
was young. No troll ever drove me away
from my work.'</p>

<p>"'Let me try, father,' said little Ashiepattle.
'I am not afraid.'</p>

<p>"His two brothers looked at him in astonishment.
'<i>You</i> try, when we have both failed!
You, who never go out of the house, what an
idea!' And they laughed in scorn.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Ashiepattle went to the
forest. But first, he asked his mother for a
good supply of food. She at once put on the
pot and made him a cheese, for she had nothing
ready. With this in his bag, he started out
merrily and was soon at work. The axe was
sent straight into the heart of the tree, and the
chips flew right and left. But just then a deep,
gruff voice was heard close by.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Stop at once,' cried the troll, 'or you
shall die.'</p>

<p>"Now, do you suppose Ashiepattle followed
his brothers' example, and that he fled from
the troll? He never thought of such a thing.
He did run, to be sure, but only for a short
distance, to the spot where he had left his
cheese. Coming back to the place where
the troll stood, he squeezed his cheese with
all his might.</p>

<p>"'Keep still, or I will squeeze you just as I
am squeezing this cheese,' he shouted.</p>

<p>"It would have made you laugh to see that
little fellow talking to the big giant in this
way; but the troll was a coward, as all big
blusterers are, and somehow Ashiepattle felt it.
His quick mind told him that he was a human
being, and wiser than all the trolls. What
do you suppose the troll did, children? He
cried, 'Spare me!' with a voice trembling
with fear. 'If you will only spare me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
will help you cut down the trees,' he added,
in haste.</p>

<p>"That afternoon great work was done in the
forest. Many great trees were laid low; for
the troll had wonderful strength in his big
arms, and he showed himself a fine helper.</p>

<p>"When night came the troll proposed that
Ashiepattle should go home with him to
supper.</p>

<p>"'It is nearer than your house,' he said.</p>

<p>"So Ashiepattle went with the troll to his
home in the forest.</p>

<p>"Before the supper could be made ready,
a fire must be made in the fireplace. The
troll said he would do this if Ashiepattle would
draw some water from the well.</p>

<p>"When the boy looked at the iron buckets
he should have to fill, he knew that he could
not even lift them; but he was too wise to say
this.</p>

<p>"'I won't bother with those buckets,' he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
told the troll; 'I will bring the well itself.
Then you will be sure to have water enough.'</p>

<p>"'O, don't do that,' cried the troll, in
fear, 'for I will have no well left. Let me
get the water, while you make the fire.'</p>

<p>"This suited Ashiepattle, of course, for it
was exactly what he wished. The water was
brought, and a great kettleful of porridge was
soon ready to eat, so the troll and the boy sat
down together at the table.</p>

<p>"'I can eat more than you, although you
are so much larger,' said Ashiepattle to his
host.</p>

<p>"'Let us see you try,' said the troll, who
felt sure he could beat the boy.</p>

<p>"What do you think Ashiepattle did?
When the troll was not looking, he seized the
bag in which he had kept the cheese, and, fastening
it in front of him, he slipped most of
the porridge he received into that, instead
of his mouth. At last it was quite full.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Ashiepattle then took his knife and cut a
hole in it, while the troll watched him in
wonder. After awhile the giant exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'I really can't eat any more. I shall have
to admit you have beaten me.'</p>

<p>"'Didn't you see what I did?' cried his
visitor. 'If you cut a hole in your stomach as
you saw me do, you can eat as long as you
wish.'</p>

<p>"'But didn't it hurt terribly?' asked the
troll.</p>

<p>"'No, indeed. Try it and see for yourself,'
replied Ashiepattle, laughing inside all the
while.</p>

<p>"The troll did as he was told, and you may
guess what happened. He fell on the floor in
agony and died in a few moments.</p>

<p>"And what did our brave little Ashiepattle
do? He searched for the stores of gold and
silver belonging to the troll, and soon succeeded
in finding them. He started for home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in great glee, for now he could pay his father's
debt and free the old man from trouble."</p>

<p>"Listen," cried Henrik, as his father finished
the story. "There is a noise outside as
though something were the matter. Do you
suppose foxes have dared to come near and
are disturbing the hens?"</p>

<p>"We will soon find out," cried the farmer,
jumping to his feet. "Hand me my gun
from the wall, good wife, and Henrik, take
yours and follow me."</p>

<p>They crept out of the house with as little
noise as possible, while Ole and Mari flattened
their noses against the window-panes. But it
was pitch-dark outside, and they could see
nothing.</p>

<p>Bang, bang! went a gun.</p>

<p>"They found him, they found him,"
shouted Ole, jumping up and down. "I do
hope he was hit."</p>

<p>A few minutes after, steps were heard coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
back to the house. Ole rushed to the
door and opened it. There stood his father
holding a large red fox by the nape of the
neck. The eyes of the animal were glassy,
for he was quite dead.</p>

<p>"He was creeping away over the snow
when we saw him," said the farmer, "and he
had one of my finest hens in his mouth. I
don't believe this was his first visit, either, for
you know, wife, we have lost several fowls
lately. Henrik, you and Ole may skin this
sly fellow and make a mat for your mother.
But it is getting late, and I must start early in
the morning, so to bed, one and all."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LUMBER CAMP</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> whole family were awake bright and
early the next morning. Mari and Greta
helped their mother in packing the birch-bark
knapsack with the provisions their father
needed to carry with him to the forest.
There must be a good supply of dried meat
and fish, sugar, butter, and flour. Last, but
not least, the coffee was packed safely inside.
What would the good man and his helpers do
without this refreshing drink? When they
returned to the hut after a day's chilling
work, a bowl of hot coffee would fill them
with new life.</p>

<p>"Ole and I will come next week and bring
you fresh supplies," said Henrik, as his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
bade them good-bye and the three men started
out on their snow-shoes over the crisp snow.</p>

<p>They were soon out of sight and the rest
of the family returned to their work. But
little Mari, who loved her father very tenderly,
kept thinking of the hard, cold work before
him. What kind of a home would he find
when he got into the forest? There would be
no shelter of any kind.</p>

<p>He and his men must go to work at once
and saw some logs, with which they would
build a rough hut. They would stuff the
chinks with moss to keep out the great cold,
or else they would freeze to death.</p>

<p>What furniture would they have? A large,
flat stone would serve as a fireplace, while the
bed would be made of poles placed side by
side and covered with moss. That was all.
They must sleep as close to the fire as possible,
and even then they would suffer greatly
during the long, freezing nights.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am so sorry the crops failed," said Mari
to her mother when she had thought of all
these things. "I almost wish father had gone
to work fishing this winter. I don't believe
that would have been as hard work."</p>

<p>"The sea has its own dangers, my daughter,"
answered her mother. "Think of the
fearful storms that rage along our coast and
the sad deaths that have come to some of our
friends. No, Mari, lumbering is hard work,
but it is safer, I think, than fishing in the
winter season."</p>

<p>Ole had come into the room while they
were talking.</p>

<p>"It's cold and uncomfortable for father this
winter, I know," he said, "but the greatest
danger is in the spring-time, when he has
to float the logs down the narrow streams to
the sawmills."</p>

<p>"Why is that so dangerous?" asked Mari.</p>

<p>"Because his work isn't over when he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
once launched the logs into the water. He
must watch them in their course and see that
they get to their journey's end. Suppose one
log gets across the stream and blocks the way?
Then father must wade out into the water and
pull that log aside with his boat-hook. He
has to spend a good deal of his time in the
water, and is likely to freeze his feet, or get
a terrible cold, at any rate. Perhaps he has to
jump on the logs as he pulls them apart.
Suppose he slips and, falling through, is
jammed to death between the logs!</p>

<p>"There, there, Mari, dear, don't cry. I
shouldn't have said all this. Father will probably
get along all right and come home safe in
the spring."</p>

<p>Henrik put his strong arms around his
little sister, and she had soon forgotten her
fears and was laughing heartily over the fairy-story
he was telling her.</p>

<p>The next week after their father left home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Henrik and Ole started out on a visit to the
camp, carrying with them a stock of provisions
large enough to supply the men for several
days longer.</p>

<p>"Take your gun, Henrik," said his mother,
"for you can't tell what wild creatures you may
meet on the way. It would be a fine surprise
for your father if you should present him with
a hare or a deer. Some fresh meat would
make a rare treat for the men."</p>

<p>The boys skimmed over mile after mile of
snowy ground, and nothing unusual happened.
No houses were in sight all this time, and
there were no tracks of living creatures. It
was lonely, and dreary, and quiet.</p>

<p>They were nearing their journey's end, and
were climbing the side of a hill, when Henrik
suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>"See, Ole," he whispered, "there are the
tracks of some four-footed beast ahead of us.
They are too heavy and big for hares'. It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
be we are near some bear's den. Look out,
for you know the old ones are sometimes very
fierce. Let us follow the tracks for a while
and see what we come to, anyway."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't we be proud if we could find
him and kill him?" answered Ole. "Roasted
bear's meat makes a pretty good dinner."</p>

<p>The boys travelled very carefully now, for
they had come into the thick woods. The
tracks suddenly came to an end at a pile of
logs lying at one side.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the bear has a snug home under
those logs," said Henrik, in a low tone, as he
seized his gun.</p>

<p>At that very moment the boys heard a sound,
and at once a huge brown bear appeared. He
moved sleepily, as though he had just been
wakened, but as soon as he got sight of the
boys he roused, and his face became fierce.</p>

<p>No time was to be lost, but Henrik was
as cool as any old hunter. His hand did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
tremble as he took careful aim. Whizz! flew
the bullet just as the bear prepared to come
at them. It would have gone straight into his
heart if he had not suddenly raised his paw,
but it entered that instead.</p>

<p>"Run for your life, Ole," shouted his
brother, as the huge and angry brute dashed
toward them.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the bear knocked Ole
down, and would have made short work of
him if it had not been for Henrik's coolness.
A second shot from his gun broke the animal's
neck. He rose on his hind legs, and plunged
blindly forward only to fall dead at Henrik's
feet.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing we are trained to be
soldiers at school," the brave boy said afterward,
when he told the story to his father.
"I really believe I should have lost my head,
if it hadn't been for that training. But I said
to myself: 'You never fail at home in hitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the mark, why should you now?' It gave
me courage, father."</p>

<p>His father smiled and answered, "You have
done well, Henrik. I am proud of you."</p>

<p>This was said as the boys sat around the
fire in the log hut that night. As soon as they
were sure the bear was really dead, they had
hurried on to the camp, which was only a short
distance away. Then, as soon as they had
told of their luck, the men went back with
them to skin the bear and cut up and bring in
the meat. They brought it to the camp on
a rough sledge.</p>

<p>"He is a beauty," exclaimed one of the
men, as he looked at the bear.</p>

<p>"And as big a one as I ever set eyes on,"
said the other. "I don't see how you ever
dared to tackle him, Henrik. I should have
hesitated for a moment, myself."</p>

<p>It was so late in the day when they all got
back to the camp that father said:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys, you had better stay all night, unless
you think your mother will worry about you."</p>

<p>"We told her we might not come home
to-day," said Ole. "It is such a long tramp,
she said we had better not try, for we would
get too tired. So it is all right."</p>

<p>How good the bear steak looked when it was
set on the rough supper-table. It was smoked
a good deal,&mdash;that was certain; but no one
spoke or even thought of that. And the table
was not elegant, for there was no cloth to
cover the rough pine boards. But the fresh
cheese, the kind mother had sent, the hard
brown bread baked by the men, with plenty
of bear steak and a bowl of steaming coffee,
made a supper "fit for a king," as the boys
declared when they could eat no more.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LAPPS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> this seems a cold place to you,
when you think of the warm farmhouse you
left yesterday," said one of the workmen to
Henrik. "You ought to go to the far north,
and visit the Lapps. Ah! you will find plenty
of cold weather there. But those queer people
don't seem to notice it very much. I suppose
that is because they have got used to it, since
they never lived anywhere else."</p>

<p>"Do tell us about them," begged Ole. "I
didn't know you had ever been to Lapland,
Adolf."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i119.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="mounded hut with a manand reindeer in front" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;IT IS ALWAYS IN THE SHAPE OF A MOUND.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Yes, when I was a young man I was a
great hunter, Ole. I have travelled all over
this country and have seen many strange
sights."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to be a hunter, too," said
Henrik. "It must be great sport getting the
wild reindeer. But go on, Adolf, and tell us
about the homes of the Lapps, and their herds
of tame reindeer, as well as the queer ways of
the people."</p>

<p>"They are a strange people, that is a fact,"
said Adolf. "They are queer-looking and
queer in their ways. They are very small,
few of them over five feet tall, and they are
quite stout. Their skin is of a dark yellow;
the hair is jet-black, coarse and straight; their
cheek-bones, high; and their eyes are blue
and small. Their little noses turn up in a
comical way, and their mouths are often open
as though they were surprised at something."</p>

<p>"I suppose they dress in fur, don't they?"
asked Ole.</p>

<p>"O yes, from head to foot. But they get
all they need from the skins of their reindeer.
They wear high boots bound tightly around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
their legs in winter-time, so they are able to
keep dry, even if they are out in the worst
snow-storm."</p>

<p>"What are their houses made of?" asked
Henrik. "I suppose lumber is scarce where
they live."</p>

<p>"Sometimes the people make a frame-work
of timber and cover it first with skins and then
with turf. Sometimes the hut is built of
stones, over which the turf is thickly laid.
But it is always in the shape of a mound."</p>

<p>"Are there any windows in the hut?"</p>

<p>"No, Ole, and so, of course, the air inside
is very close and unpleasant. There isn't even
a chimney. A hole is left in the roof large
enough to let out the smoke; that is all.
When the short summer comes round, the
Lapps prefer to live in deer-skin tents, and I
can't say I blame them."</p>

<p>"Did you ever visit them in their homes,
Adolf?" asked Henrik.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I stayed with a family of them over
night. They seemed very friendly and tried
to make my visit pleasant, but I didn't enjoy it
very much, it was such a dirty, smoky place.</p>

<p>"In the middle of the room was a stone
fireplace, over which hung the kettle when our
supper was cooked. They all squatted on
deer-skins around the fire. When I had
been there a few minutes, I heard a noise
overhead. I looked up and saw a dear little
blue-eyed baby, swinging in a hammock and
cooing to me. I reached up and took it down,
and it snuggled in my arms as though it knew
I was a friend."</p>

<p>"What did you have for supper?" asked
the farmer.</p>

<p>"Everything came from the reindeer, of
course. There was plenty of rich milk, besides
a good-sized cheese and a meat stew. I
have eaten worse meals since, many times."</p>

<p>"But how did you sleep?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"The beds were easily made by stretching
deer-skins on the floor. We covered ourselves
with more skins, and lay snug and warm
till morning."</p>

<p>"Did you sleep more warmly than we
do here?" The farmer laughed as he said
it.</p>

<p>"I must say I did," replied Adolf, with an
answering laugh.</p>

<p>"Although the Lapps' huts are far from
beautiful, they are made so that wind and snow
cannot blow in, at any rate." Adolf pointed
to a ridge of snow that had sifted in through
the wall, although they had stuffed the cracks
as well as they could with dried moss.</p>

<p>"But, dear me! the Lapps wouldn't mind
it very much if it did," he went on. "The
men will lie down to sleep in an open field
on rocks or snow, if they are not near their
home. They are not afraid of the cold, and
it seldom seems to hurt them, either.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"As I lay on the floor of the hut that night,
I could see rows of smoked meat and fish
hanging against the sides of the walls. They
have neither storehouses nor closets, so they
are obliged to keep their provisions in the
huts.</p>

<p>"The next morning I went out among the
reindeer with the chief of the settlement. I
believe there were more than a thousand reindeer
in sight. It was milking-day and the
men were having a lively time of it. They
had to catch each animal and hold it still with
a lasso while the milking was done."</p>

<p>"Why did you speak of milking-day,
Adolf? Don't the Lapps milk the reindeer
as often as we do our cows?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. It is done only once a
week, because the creatures are so wild. They
are not gentle and tame, as you have probably
supposed. They can be managed very well
in driving, however. It is great sport to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
ride behind a team of reindeer, for one flies
over the snow like the wind. Their masters
sometimes drive them a hundred miles in a
day."</p>

<p>"That is good, for I have heard that
the Lapps don't stay in one place all their
lives. They are a wandering people, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ole, but one reason for that is the
need of finding good feeding-grounds for their
deer. When one place becomes bare, they
must seek another. Then, again, in the summer-time
they like to go to the rivers and
camp beside them for the sake of the salmon
fishing. They are as fond as we of a good
dish of salmon for dinner."</p>

<p>"What do the reindeer feed on?" asked
Henrik.</p>

<p>"In winter they paw away the snow and
find the lichen, which is a little gray plant
very much like the moss you see growing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the mountainside about here. In summer
they eat the young and tender shoots on the
bushes and low trees. They are very hardy
creatures and among the most useful."</p>

<p>"Just think!" cried Ole. "The reindeer
furnish the Lapps with everything they need,&mdash;their
clothing, food, and shelter; and, as if
that were not enough, they make good beasts
of burden, and carry their masters wherever
they wish to go."</p>

<p>"I shall tell Mari all about them when I
get home," Ole went on. "I know one
question my busy little sister will ask at once.
She will say, 'What do the women and children
do with themselves all the time?' How
shall I answer that question, Adolf?"</p>

<p>"You may tell Mari there is plenty of
work for them. They dress the reindeer
skins, and make lovely rugs and warm slippers
turned up at the toes and bound with
red."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, yes, Ole, your mother has a pair
of slippers made by the Lapp women," interrupted
his father. "I bought them for her
at Bergen, and she wears them on cold winter
mornings."</p>

<p>"That is so, I remember them; but I
never thought about the Lapps when I looked
at them," answered Ole. "Is there anything
else the women of Lapland make,
Adolf?"</p>

<p>"Many things. They showed me knives
and spoons they had shaped out of the horns
of the reindeer. They were very pretty, and
a great deal of time must have been spent on
the carving. The men and boys do most of
this last work. I really think the most wonderful
thing I saw was the thread the women
make of the reindeer sinews. It is fine and
even, yet very strong. I wish I could have
seen them making it."</p>

<p>Adolf yawned. "I am so sleepy I think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
must be bedtime. There's a hard day's work
before us to-morrow."</p>

<p>After fresh wood had been laid on the fire,
the party quickly settled themselves for the
night's rest.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOLIDAY FROLICS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Father's</span> coming, father's coming!" cried
Mari as she stood looking down the snow-covered
valley.</p>

<p>She rushed into the house and put on her
skis, then skimmed across the fields with long
strides.</p>

<p>"Everything is ready," she told her father
as soon as she reached him. "And now we
shall have a lovely Christmas because you have
come."</p>

<p>Yes, everything was ready for the greatest
day of the year. Even the birds were not
forgotten, for a fresh sheaf of wheat had been
fastened on the pole where the magpie had
hidden the silver brooch. Ole had made a
new collar for the dog, Kyle; Henrik had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
shot enough wild game for the Christmas
dinner; Mari and Greta had helped their
mother in making some wonderful cakes.</p>

<p>There was nothing for the tired father to do
except to sit in the chimney-corner and frolic
with his children. It was a jolly time, for no
one was expected to be quiet now, and all were
allowed to do as they pleased.</p>

<p>Christmas comes but once a year, and the
children realized it fully.</p>

<p>They played games and told stories; they
danced and sang to the music of Henrik's
violin. There was no spinning, or even crocheting,
for the girls, while the boys did only
what farm work was needed to keep the horses
and cattle comfortable.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day a party of the villagers
came to the farm to share in the games and
feasting. Even the magpie, mischievous little
fellow, seemed to enjoy the fun. He flew
from one to the others of the party and, lighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
on the shoulders of the young girls
suddenly, would startle them and make every
one else laugh.</p>

<p>The baby, bless his heart, had the best time
of all. He was not left to hang in his cradle
for a single moment. Everybody wished to
hold him, and he was passed from one to another
of the company, where he enjoyed himself
fingering the shining silver ornaments of
his friends.</p>

<p>He had his new toys to amuse him, also, for
Henrik and Ole had carved him a doll and a
queer-looking horse out of wood.</p>

<p>Everybody was jolly and happy, and there
was much drinking of coffee and shaking of
hands. It was eleven o'clock when the tired
but happy children climbed the steps of their
beds to dream of the good time just over.</p>

<p>After this, it did not seem a very long time
to Fastilevn, which is the next best holiday
to Christmas. At least, that is what Mari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
thought, and if you lived with her you would
surely think so too.</p>

<p>Fastilevn comes in the early spring, on the
first Monday of Lent, and on that day the
Norse children are allowed to do exactly as
they wish. Their parents may be strict and
stern all the rest of the year, but at Fastilevn
all rules are laid aside and the little ones may
run wild if they like.</p>

<p>Cakes and buns! If you could see Mari,
Greta, and their brothers eat sweet things on
this day, you would wonder where they could
possibly find room in their stomachs to stow
them all away.</p>

<p>The feasting was not the best part of the
fun, however. You would never guess what
strange thing the children were allowed to do
on that day. They might whip their mother!
Of course, it was all in sport. The boys took
long birch twigs and fastened many tissue-papers
and coloured ribbons and tinsel upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
them. The night before the great day, these
twigs were set up in a corner of the living-room,
all ready for the next day's fun.</p>

<p>With the first light of morning those gay
switches began to be plied, while the children
followed their mother about, laughing
gaily all the while.</p>

<p>How long did the fun last, do you suppose?
Until the last shred of paper was gone from
each switch.</p>

<p>And how do you suppose there ever came
to be such an odd custom? The Norse
parents believe firmly in the old maxim,
"Spare the rod and spoil the child." Their
children are likely to be often whipped for
wrong-doing; Fastilevn is supposed to make
up for twelve months of whippings, whether
they were deserved or not.</p>

<p>Mari has seldom needed punishment, for
she is a good, helpful little girl; but she enjoys
Fastilevn very much, nevertheless.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The holiday came to an end, as all days
must, whether they are good or bad. In the
evening, when the bare switches had been
thrown away, Mari went to her mother and
put her arms around her neck, whispering:</p>

<p>"Mamma, I wouldn't really hurt you for
the world, even if you had to give me a thousand
whippings. And I am going to try
harder than ever to be your little helper."</p>

<p>The good woman's eyes filled with tears.
"God bless you, little daughter," she said,
as she bent down and kissed her.</p>
